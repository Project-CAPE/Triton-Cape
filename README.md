## Overview
### Description
Our App provides student the information about all the past courses in UCSD, including the instructor evaluations and course evaluations. The users can search for the information with the course number and instructor's name easily.  

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** The computer version for this app has been created by UCSD. Hence, we are looking forward to making a mobile version for this app. 
- **Story:** Analyze how students from past quarters evaluated their Professors and TAs; Give students some insights about how the classes were conducted; Allow students to decide whether or not they should take the class with a particular instructor, etc.
- **Market:** UCSD students are the major group that will use this app. Instructors, on the otherhand, can also take a look at this app to understand more about the students' experience and adjust their teaching style accordingly
- **Habit:** This app can be use whenever students/instructors feel needed. However, most people will use this app when the class schedule is out, and/or when students register new classes.
- **Scope:** This app is defined very clearly. It helps the users to get help information about evaluations of all courses at UCSD.
